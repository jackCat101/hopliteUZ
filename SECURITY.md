# Security Policy (HopliteUZ)

I hope I don't f##k security things up, but I will only ever modify files as needed for Hoplite.

# Security Policy (UZdoom)

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of UZDoom is ever supported - older versions may have vulnerabilities, including older major versions. Legacy trees are maintained separately and sometimes by a different maintainer.
